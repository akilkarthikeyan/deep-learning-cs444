Here is a guide to help you find a right learning rate:\n","- Try values ranging from 0.0005 to 5.0 to see the impact on model accuracy.\n","- If the loss oscillates a lot or the loss diverges, the learning rate may be too high. Try decreasing it by a factor of 10 (e.g. from 0.5 to 0.05).\n","- If the loss decreases very slowly, the learning rate may be too low and the training can take a long time. Try increasing it by a factor of 10.\n","- You can also try adding a learning rate decay to slowly reduce the learning rate over each training epoch. For example, multiply the learning rate by 0.95 after each epoch.\n","- Plot training and validation accuracy over epochs for different learning rates. This will help you visualize the impact of the learning rate.\n","- [Here](https://towardsdatascience.com/https-medium-com-dashingaditya-rakhecha-understanding-learning-rate-dd5da26bb6de) is a detailed guide to learning rate.\n","\n","### Hyperparameter 2: Number of Epochs\n","- An epoch is a complete iterative pass over the training dataset.
